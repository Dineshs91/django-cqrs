# django-cqrs

A demo application to show how cqrs can be implemented in Django

## Bring up the services.

cd into the project root. (After cloning this repo)

Bring up the services up.

`docker-compose up -d --build`

Visit `http://localhost:8000/posts/`

Shutdown the containers.

`docker-compose down`

**NOTE:**
For docker commands refer [this](https://github.com/Dineshs91/init/blob/master/docker/README.md)

## Test events replay

`docker exec -it cqrs_web_1 blog/demo/replay_three.sh`

`docker exec -it cqrs_web_1 blog/demo/replay_all.sh`

## Architecture

Currently there are only two event `PostCreatedEvent` and `PostUpdatedEvent`.

I tried to replicate the concepts from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0goyZ9F4bg&t=2160s)
I did not implement the `command` part. 

There are 2 things, event data and entity data. Any state change to the application is captured through an event
`(PostCreatedEvent, PostUpdatedEvent)`. For storing event data I've used MongoDB and for entity data PostgresDB.

Creation of event data is handled in django forms. Forms `save` is overloaded with the [code](https://github.com/Dineshs91/django-cqrs/blob/master/blog/posts/forms.py) which creates the events and makes a call
to event handler. Event handler creates the application state in turn which is stored in postgres. 

So all the writes go through `Events` and `EventHandler` and reads happen on the entity data which is stored in postgres.

If anybody wants to help out or interested about this, please open a PR or start a discussion in the issues section.
